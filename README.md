# Flip-N-Find
This is a fun and interactive memory game where players flip cards to find matching pairs. The game tracks the number of moves and time taken. Once all pairs are matched, players can submit their name and score, which is saved to a leaderboard. The game features a timer, move counter, and displays top scores from all players.
